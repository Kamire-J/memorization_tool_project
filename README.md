This is the *Memorization Tool* project I made myself.


<p>It would be great to remember anything at any time. Alas, our mental capacity is limited. The good thing is that there are a lot of tools to help us memorize things.Â In this project, we are going to create a tool for memorizing lines, poems, speeches, and other text-based materials.</p>
